# Image Requirements for AI-ML Fundamentals Module

## ai-ml-relationship.png
A visual diagram showing the relationship between AI and ML, with:
- AI as a large umbrella
- Machine Learning as a subset within AI
- Deep Learning as a subset within Machine Learning
Use clear visual hierarchy with labels and brief explanations of each area.

## learning-types.png
A side-by-side comparison of the three main types of machine learning:
1. Supervised Learning - Show input data with labels and the system learning patterns
2. Unsupervised Learning - Show input data without labels and the system finding its own patterns
3. Reinforcement Learning - Show an agent interacting with an environment, receiving rewards/penalties
Include visual metaphors that reinforce the learning style differences.

## ml-pipeline-diagram.gif
An animated flow diagram showing the ML pipeline from data to deployment:
1. Data Collection & Preparation (raw data â†’ cleaned data)
2. Feature Engineering (selecting and transforming important attributes)
3. Model Selection & Training (showing various model options and training process)
4. Evaluation (testing with metrics visualization)
5. Deployment (model being implemented in production)
6. Maintenance (ongoing updates and monitoring)
Animation should show the flow of data through each stage.

## classification-metrics.png
A visual explainer of classification metrics with:
- A confusion matrix visualized
- Visual explanations of Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
- Small example calculations to illustrate each metric
Use color coding to distinguish between true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

## regression-metrics.png
Illustrations of regression metrics showing:
- Example regression line with actual data points
- Visual representation of errors
- Formulas and simple explanations for MAE and RMSE
Use clear visual elements to show the difference between predicted and actual values.

## common-pitfalls.png
A visual guide to overfitting, underfitting, bias, and variance:
- Overfitting: Model following training data too closely (like connecting all dots)
- Underfitting: Model being too simple (like missing obvious patterns)
- Bias: Systematic errors showing predictions consistently off in one direction
- Variance: Showing how model performs differently with different training sets
Include visual metaphors that make these abstract concepts more concrete.

## algorithm-comparison.png
A visual comparison of common algorithms with simple visual metaphors:
- Linear Regression: Line of best fit through points
- Logistic Regression: S-curve dividing categories
- Decision Trees: Branching tree structure with decision points
- Random Forests: Multiple trees working together
- Neural Networks: Simple network diagram with interconnected nodes
Include a small real-world example icon for each algorithm.

## neural-network-anatomy.png
A detailed but accessible diagram of a neural network showing:
- Input layer (with labeled inputs)
- Hidden layers (with weights visualized)
- Output layer (with predictions)
- Forward propagation (arrows showing data flow)
- Backpropagation (arrows showing error correction)
Use color coding to make the different components clear.

## ai-limitations.png
A visual representation of AI's current limitations:
- Genuine Understanding: AI detecting patterns vs. human comprehension
- Common Sense Reasoning: AI struggling with obvious human knowledge
- Causal Reasoning: AI seeing correlations but missing true causes
- Creativity: The debatable line between generation and true creativity
Use contrasting imagery between AI approaches and human capabilities.
