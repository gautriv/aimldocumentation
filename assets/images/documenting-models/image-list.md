# Image Requirements for Documenting Models Module

## documentation-layers.png
A layered pyramid diagram showing the four documentation layers:
1. Executive Summary Layer (top) - Simple overview visuals
2. User Experience Layer - Interface and workflow visuals
3. Technical Overview Layer - Architecture and flow diagrams
4. Deep Dive Layer (bottom) - Detailed technical diagrams
Each layer should visually represent its audience and complexity level, with arrows showing how users might navigate between layers.

## model-card-anatomy.png
A visual template of a model card with:
- Clear sections highlighted (Model Overview, Details, Performance, etc.)
- Annotations explaining the purpose of each section
- Visual hierarchy showing the importance/priority of different elements
- Example data points for a fictional model
Design it to look like an actual card/document with callouts explaining each component.

## model-card-example.gif
An animated visualization showing:
1. A blank model card template
2. Information being filled in for a product recommendation system
3. Key elements being highlighted one by one
4. The completed card with annotations about what makes it effective
Animation should focus on the process of documenting the model step by step.

## model-types-documentation.png
A comparison chart showing documentation approaches for different model types:
- Supervised Learning - Key documentation elements with small visual examples
- Natural Language Processing - Documentation elements with text/language visualization
- Computer Vision - Documentation elements with image/visual detection examples
- Generative Models - Documentation elements with generation process visuals
Include icons and visual cues that represent each model type's unique considerations.

## data-documentation.png
A visual guide to documenting data for AI models:
- Data sources (with icons for different source types)
- Data processing pipeline visualization
- Data characteristics documentation (with example charts)
- Data limitations and biases (with warning indicators)
Show the relationship between data documentation and model performance.

## evaluation-metrics-visualization.png
A dashboard-style visualization showing:
- Different charts/graphs for key metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.)
- Before/after comparisons of model iterations
- Performance across different data segments
- Visual alerts for areas needing attention
Design it to look like an actual model evaluation dashboard with annotations.

## model-lifecycle-diagram.png
A circular diagram showing the model documentation needs at different lifecycle stages:
1. Development - Documentation needs during creation
2. Training - Documentation during training process
3. Evaluation - Documentation of performance assessment
4. Deployment - Documentation for implementation
5. Monitoring - Documentation for ongoing tracking
6. Retraining - Documentation for updates and versions
Include icons representing the key documentation artifacts needed at each stage.

## model-comparison-template.png
A side-by-side comparison template for documenting multiple models:
- Feature comparison table with visual indicators
- Performance metrics with mini-charts
- Tradeoffs visualization (speed vs. accuracy, etc.)
- Decision guidance flowchart
Design it as a reusable template that technical writers could adapt for different model comparisons.

## interactive-documentation-example.gif
An animated example of interactive model documentation showing:
1. Static documentation transitioning to interactive elements
2. User adjusting parameters and seeing results change
3. Exploration of model behavior through interactive visualizations
4. Different views for different user needs (technical vs. simple)
Focus on illustrating the benefits of interactive documentation over static content.
