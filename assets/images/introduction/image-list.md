# Image Requirements for Introduction Module

## ai-doc-journey.png
A welcoming illustration showing a path or journey metaphor with signposts representing different aspects of AI documentation. Include elements like a starting point labeled "beginner" and an endpoint showing "expert documentation writer" with AI/ML visual elements (neural networks, code, documents) along the path.

## ai-vs-traditional.png
A side-by-side comparison diagram showing:
- Left side: Traditional software documentation (deterministic, input → process → predictable output)
- Right side: AI documentation (showing uncertainty, black box nature, probabilistic outputs)
Visual emphasis on the unpredictability and complexity of AI systems compared to traditional software.

## trifecta.png
A triangular or Venn diagram showing the three key pillars of AI documentation:
- Technical Accuracy (represented with technical symbols/code)
- Accessibility (represented with diverse user icons)
- Transparency (represented with clarity/openness symbols)
The intersection of these three should be highlighted as the "sweet spot" for effective documentation.

## documentation-audiences.png
A circular arrangement of different user personas with brief visual indicators of their needs:
- Data Scientists (with algorithm/math symbols)
- Software Developers (with code/API symbols)
- Product Managers (with roadmap/feature symbols)
- End Users (with simplified interface symbols)
- Executives (with dashboard/overview symbols)
- Regulators (with compliance/checklist symbols)
Each should have a small visual indicator of the type of documentation they typically need.

## documentation-lifecycle.gif
An animated circular flow showing the evolution of documentation through:
1. Early Development (sketches, planning docs)
2. Production (technical docs, APIs)
3. User-Facing (tutorials, guides)
4. Governance (compliance docs)
With smooth transitions between stages and growing documentation artifacts at each stage.

## persona-exercise.png
A template/worksheet example showing:
- A fictional AI system (e.g., recommendation engine)
- Three different user personas mapped out
- For each persona: technical level, key questions, and preferred doc format
Make it look like a partially completed worksheet to inspire completion.

## documentation-pitfalls.png
A set of 4 warning signs or pitfall illustrations:
- "It Just Works" Syndrome (black box with question marks)
- Jargon Overload (overwhelming technical terms)
- Oversimplification (magic wand over complex system)
- Perfect System Myth (system with no limitations shown)
Use warning symbols and clear visual metaphors for each pitfall.

## course-roadmap.png
A visual roadmap/map showing all course modules as destinations or stops on a journey, with the current module highlighted. Include small icons representing each module's focus, connected by a path that shows progression from basics to advanced topics.
