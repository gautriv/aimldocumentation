  title: Writing for AI/ML Products
---

Welcome to the world of Artificial Intelligence (AI)! It's like the wizardry of modern times, but instead of wands, you have algorithms, and instead of magic spells, you’ve got Python scripts. Let’s start by understanding the basics.

## Lesson 1: What is AI, and Why Should You Care?

**What is AI?** AI is the ability of machines to mimic human intelligence. It's the tech behind chatbots, self-driving cars, and even those eerily accurate Netflix recommendations. Imagine training a machine to do your homework but without asking for snacks every 10 minutes.

**What is Machine Learning (ML)?** ML is a subset of AI where machines learn from data. Think of it like teaching a parrot to talk, but instead of crackers, you reward it with data to make smarter predictions over time.

{% include activity.html content=" <b> 1: AI in Your Life </b>
<li> Take a piece of paper (or open a notes app). </li>
<li>Write down five examples of AI you’ve encountered today. Examples could include a virtual assistant, product recommendations, or autocorrect (which may have caused you to send some interesting texts).</li>
" %}

{% include tip.html content="Share your examples in the comments section below for some fun debates!
" %}

**How Does AI Work?** Here’s a simplified version:

1. Input Data: Think of this as the ingredients for cooking.
2. Algorithm: The recipe or method to cook the dish.
3. Output: The final meal—or in AI terms, the prediction or decision.

{% include activity.html content=" <b> 2: Analogies Game </b>
<br>
Explain AI in the simplest terms possible using an analogy. For example:
<li> AI is like… teaching a toddler to sort their toys by shape and color. </li>
<li>Share your analogy with a friend or a colleague. The more ridiculous (but accurate), the better!</li>
" %}

## Lesson 2: Key Terms for Technical Writers
Okay, let’s talk about the jargon. AI comes with its own dictionary, and as a technical writer, you’re going to use these terms a lot.

**Core AI Terms You Must Know**

- **Algorithm:** A set of rules a computer follows to solve a problem. Think of it as a GPS for data.
- **Model:** The result of training an algorithm with data. It’s like a super-smart brain (but less moody).
- **Training:** Teaching the model using data. Imagine helping someone cram for an exam.
- **Inference:** When the model takes the exam and gives you answers.

{% include activity.html content=" <b> 3: AI Term Detective </b>
<br>
Here are a few sentences where technical terms are intentionally misused. Your job is to correct them:
<li> “I just trained my algorithm with inference data.” </li>
<li>“The model cooked a prediction using recipes.”</li>
<li>“The AI uses training for predictions without models.”</li>
Post your corrected sentences, and see how sharp your AI detective skills are!

## Lesson 3: A Day in the Life of AI
Let’s take AI for a test drive. Imagine AI is your virtual intern. What can it do for you in a day?

**Morning:**
AI helps you write a concise, engaging email. (You meant to write, “Looking forward to the meeting,” but AI autocorrected it to, “Let’s crush the meeting!”)

**Afternoon:**
You’re stuck in traffic? AI maps an alternate route. If only it could get you coffee.

**Evening:**
AI suggests a rom-com for your movie night based on your mood. Romantic? Definitely AI. “Suggestions based on your emotional profile”? That’s ML.

{% include activity.html content=" <b> 4: Personify Your AI </b>
<br>
Write a short (50-word) paragraph imagining AI as your personal assistant. Give it a personality—does it crack jokes, is it overly polite, or does it insist on correcting your grammar?
" %}

## Lesson 4: Closing with Context
Let’s tie it all together. AI isn’t about replacing humans—it’s about making our lives easier (and maybe more entertaining). As a technical writer, your job is to simplify AI so that everyone can benefit from its magic.

{% include activity.html content=" <b> 5: Elevator Pitch </b>
<br>
Imagine you have 60 seconds to explain AI to someone who has never heard of it. Write your pitch. The simpler and more engaging, the better. Practice it aloud!
" %}

{% include next.html content="You’ve built a foundation for understanding AI and ML. Now it’s time to roll up your sleeves and get into the writing part. In Module 2, we’ll dive into structuring your content for AI/ML products, identifying your audience, and writing for different user personas.
" %}

{% include curious.html content="Before moving on, research a popular AI tool (like ChatGPT, TensorFlow, or a virtual assistant). Bring one question you have about it into the next module—because curiosity is the first step to great writing!
