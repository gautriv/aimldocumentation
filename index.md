  title: Writing for AI/ML Products
---

Imagine this: You're in a futuristic cafe, and the barista is a robot. You place your order, and within seconds, your perfectly brewed coffee appears. This isn't magic—it's a blend of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) at work. The robot barista understands your preferences, learns from your previous orders, and continuously improves its service.

Exciting, isn’t it? AI and ML are no longer concepts of the future—they’re the forces shaping our everyday lives, from the apps we use to the cars we drive. In this module, you’ll embark on a journey to demystify AI and ML. We’ll explore what these terms mean, how they work, and why they matter, especially to you as a technical writer.

## What is AI, and Why Should You Care?

Let’s break it down. Think of AI as a brilliant brain that enables machines to mimic human intelligence. It’s about teaching computers to perform tasks like recognizing faces, driving cars, or even creating art.

Now, ML is a subset of AI. It’s like teaching a child how to ride a bicycle. You don’t explain every detail; instead, you let them practice, fall, and learn. Similarly, ML allows machines to learn from data rather than following explicit instructions.

<li> Take a piece of paper (or open a notes app). </li>
<li>Write down five examples of AI you’ve encountered today. Examples could include a virtual assistant, product recommendations, or autocorrect (which may have caused you to send some interesting texts).</li>

**How Does AI Work?** Here’s a simplified version:

1. Input Data: Think of this as the ingredients for cooking.
2. Algorithm: The recipe or method to cook the dish.
3. Output: The final meal—or in AI terms, the prediction or decision.

{% include activity.html content=" <b> 2: Analogies Game </b>
<br>
Explain AI in the simplest terms possible using an analogy. For example:
<li> AI is like… teaching a toddler to sort their toys by shape and color. </li>
<li>Share your analogy with a friend or a colleague. The more ridiculous (but accurate), the better!</li>

## Key Terms for Technical Writers

Okay, let’s talk about the jargon. AI comes with its own dictionary, and as a technical writer, you’re going to use these terms a lot.

**Core AI Terms You Must Know**

- **Algorithm:** A set of rules a computer follows to solve a problem. Think of it as a GPS for data.
- **Data:** The fuel for AI—without it, machines can’t learn.
- **Neural Networks:** The machine's version of the human brain, enabling it to recognize patterns and make decisions.
- **Model:** The result of training an algorithm with data. It’s like a super-smart brain (but less moody).
- **Training:** Teaching the model using data. Imagine helping someone cram for an exam.
- **Inference:** When the model takes the exam and gives you answers.

{% include activity.html content=" <b> 3: AI Term Detective </b>
<br>
Here are a few sentences where technical terms are intentionally misused. Your job is to correct them:
<li> “I just trained my algorithm with inference data.” </li>
<li>“The model cooked a prediction using recipes.”</li>
<li>“The AI uses training for predictions without models.”</li>
Post your corrected sentences, and see how sharp your AI detective skills are!

## A Day in the Life of AI

Let’s take AI for a test drive. Imagine AI is your virtual intern. What can it do for you in a day?

**Morning:**
AI helps you write a concise, engaging email. (You meant to write, “Looking forward to the meeting,” but AI autocorrected it to, “Let’s crush the meeting!”)

**Afternoon:**
You’re stuck in traffic? AI maps an alternate route. If only it could get you coffee.

**Evening:**
AI suggests a rom-com for your movie night based on your mood. Romantic? Definitely AI. “Suggestions based on your emotional profile”? That’s ML.

{% include activity.html content=" <b> 4: Personify Your AI </b>
<br>
Write a short (50-word) paragraph imagining AI as your personal assistant. Give it a personality—does it crack jokes, is it overly polite, or does it insist on correcting your grammar?

## Why Should Technical Writers Care About AI/ML?
Here’s the kicker: AI/ML isn’t just for engineers. These technologies need clear, user-friendly documentation to thrive. Whether it’s explaining how an AI-based product works or detailing an ML algorithm, your role as a technical writer bridges the gap between complex concepts and everyday users.

Imagine you’re tasked with documenting Mia’s voice assistant. Wouldn’t it be fascinating to explain how Ally processes voice commands or how it learns user preferences? That’s the magic you can create.

## Ask Yourself
- How do I simplify a complex topic like AI for a non-technical audience?
- What are the key challenges users might face with AI/ML systems?
- How can I make my writing approachable yet accurate?
