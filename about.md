    <h2 class="section-title">So... Why Did I Create This Course?</h2>
    
    <p>Hi there! I'm Gaurav, and my journey into AI documentation didn’t start with a strategy—it started with confusion, caffeine, and a mildly dramatic identity crisis.</p>

<p>At one point, I found myself staring at an AI model so complex it felt like it was judging me for not having a PhD. It was supposed to be revolutionary—an algorithm that could predict what people wanted before they even wanted it. But when someone asked, “So… what does it <em>do</em>?” the room went quiet, like a Netflix buffer wheel on bad Wi-Fi.</p>

<p>That moment stuck with me. If I, someone fairly tech-savvy and armed with a decent amount of curiosity (and coffee), couldn’t make sense of this thing, how could anyone else? I realized the real challenge wasn’t building AI—it was explaining it without sounding like a malfunctioning robot yourself.</p>

<p>So I took it on myself to figure it out. I dove into the jargon, decoded the equations, and kept asking “why” and “how” until I could explain the AI like I was telling a bedtime story—if the bedtime story involved neural networks and didn't put people to sleep.</p>

<p>Over time, I saw a shift. When I started explaining AI in plain English (with the occasional metaphor and dad joke), people leaned in instead of zoning out. They started asking smart questions. They wanted to know more. Some even nodded like they <em>actually</em> got it. I’m pretty sure one person cried tears of clarity. Or maybe that was allergies. Hard to say.</p>

<p>That’s when it clicked: AI’s biggest obstacle isn’t complexity—it’s communication. Even the smartest model won’t get adopted if people don’t understand what it does, why it matters, or when it might be confidently wrong.</p>

<p>I created this course because I’ve lived through the “what-is-happening” phase and made it to the “aha!” phase. And I want to help others do the same—whether you're explaining AI to execs, users, your cat, or just trying to make sense of it yourself.</p>

        <p>I've spent years wearing many hats—developer, technical writer, documentation specialist, and unofficial translator between AI engineers and everyone else. I currently work at Red Hat, where I spend my time making complex technologies understandable, breaking down advanced concepts, and advocating for clearer communication about AI systems.</p>
        
        <p>I believe that great documentation is essential for responsible AI. It's the difference between AI that empowers people and AI that confuses or alienates them.</p>
        
        <p>When I'm not fighting the good fight for better documentation, I'm either lifting weights at the gym, hiking somewhere in the Himalayas, or plotting my dream of retiring in Uttarakhand with a print business.</p>
        
        <p>This course is everything I wish I had when I first started documenting AI systems. I've navigated the challenges of explaining complex models and probabilistic outputs so you can learn from my experience.</p>
